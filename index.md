Hello!
I am a Ph.D student in CSE at Seoul National University, and studying under the supervision of [Prof. Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/).

My research interests are in the field of 3D Place Recognition and Visual Localization, especially about
(i) understanding the scene from images and point clouds, 
(ii) dealing with 2D-3D cross-modalities, 
and (iii) utilizing high-level semantic information for place recognition.

### Development Projects

- **DeepGuider** <sup>2019.02 - Current</sup> <a class="code" href="https://github.com/deepguider/DeepGuider">[code]</a> <br/> 
The DeepGuider Project is a national government-funded research project focused on developing a navigation guidance system for robots to navigate urban environments without pre-mapping.
I contribute to finding clues to locate autonomous robots by detecting and recognizing points of interests (POIs) in images of a scene, including text, landmarks, and doors for indoor-outdoor transition, while also developing robust training methods for environmental changes.

- **PRIDE: 3D Place Recognition In Dynamic Environment** <sup>2022.03 - Current</sup> <a class="code" href="https://github.com/minnjung/PRIDE">[code]</a> <br/> 
This work proposes a new dataset called PRIDE, which includes dynamic objects such as cars and pedestrians, for 3D place recognition in dynamic environments that are more realistic and challenging than current benchmark datasets.
The proposed PRIDE-Net architecture with a new loss function focuses on extracting discriminative global descriptors and capturing global context using spatial information, while being robust to dynamic environments.
Experiments on the PRIDE dataset and existing benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms previous methods and that each proposed module effectively improves performance.
The code will be released after acceptance.

- **FCAT: Fully Convolutional Network with Self-Attention for Point Cloud based Place Recognition** <sup>2020.12 - 2022.02</sup> <a class="code" href="https://github.com/minnjung/FCAT">[code]</a> <br/> 
We construct a novel network named FCAT (Fully Convolutional network with a self-ATtention unit) that can generate a discriminative and context-aware global descriptor for place recognition from the 3D point cloud.
It features with a novel sparse fully convolutional network architecture with sparse tensors for extracting informative local geometric features computed in a single pass.
It also involves a self-attention module for 3D point cloud to encode local context information between local descriptors.
The code will be released after acceptance.

- **Bayesian Deep Learning course** <sup>2018.02 - 2018.07</sup> <a class="code" href="https://www.edwith.org/bayesiandeeplearning">[lecture]</a> <br/> 
To understand deep learning papers, we explain the basic concepts of probability and Bayesian, and introduce papers related to Bayesian neural networks.
This lecture can be taken through [edwith](https://www.edwith.org/) of Naver Connect.

- **Sketch based Face Image Generation with Text Mapping** <sup>2017.09 - 2018.02</sup> <a class="code" href="https://github.com/hyungsuklim/metamon">[code]</a> <br/> 
A typical sketch might have been uncomfortable when a person or program was used to map a person's features in detail.
This process is limited not only because it is very complex and requires technicians, but also because it creates a feeling of incompatibility with real people.
This program, named Metamon, makes a picture of a person's face by entering the image of the border sketch of the person's face and the text information that shows the characteristics of the face.

- **Arduino & Raspberry Pi & Internet of Things (IoT) Tutorial** <sup>2016.12 - 2017.03</sup> <a class="code" href="http://makewith.co/page/user/1152/profile">[project]</a> <br/> 
I create tutorial pages with Youtube videos and code for beginners in Arduino kit and Raspberry Pi development.
I introduce the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) and work on a mini-project using [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

- **Sogang Navigation and Introduction (SNI)** <sup>2015.03 - 2015.07</sup> <a class="code" href="https://github.com/hyungsuklim/SGCS-Assignment/tree/master/2015/Data-Structure_2015/Project">[code]</a> <br/> 
We develop a navigation system that introduces the internal facilities of each building and displays the shortest route and time from building to building using the Floyd-Washall algorithm.
To build data for the development, we measured the time taken by walking directly on each path.
